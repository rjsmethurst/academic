              <h2>The Hitchiker's Guide to Writing your Thesis</h2>
            </header>
            <p>So you’re finally writing up your thesis. Congratulations! Or commiserations? I’m not entirely sure which one it should be. Anyway this post is going to be particularly relevant to Oxford Astrophysics PhD students, but whoever you are reader, I hope this is useful to you.</p>
            <p>First of all, if you’ve started writing, make sure you’ve also filled in this form - it’s the one bit of admin that’s needed to tell Exam Schools what you’re thesis title will be and, more importantly, what date you’ll be handing it in on. Take it to Ashling and she’ll make sure it gets signed by all the people it needs to and sent to the right admin office to get filed. Once that date is set, it can be changed if necessary but otherwise burn that date in your memory because everything you do from now on is going to lead up to then.</p>
            <p>Next up, LaTeX template! The template you wan’t is called ociamthesis.cls and is available <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/members/it/faqs/latex/thesis-class">here</a>. All the guidelines for page margins, font size (12pt) and double spaced lines which are <a href="https://www2.physics.ox.ac.uk/study-here/postgraduates/particle-physics/guidelines-for-thesis-writing">listed on the Physics website </a> are already coded into the template so you don’t have to worry about a thing. It even provides the University of Oxford logo for your title page which should look something like this:</p>

            <a><img src="images/example_thesis.png" alt="example thesis front page", width="100%"/></a>

            <p>On your title page you need: your thesis title, your name, college and institution. You also need what degree your submitting thesis for and in which term. The Physics website also states that a thesis needs to be no more than 250 pages (unless you're a theoretical physics student). Again the ociamthesis.cls takes care of all of this. You’ll then need an abstract, your acknowledgements and what’s called a statement of originality. Which should read something like this (heavily paraphrased):</p>

            <p><em>“I carried out the work in this thesis at the Department of Blah, University of Blah between Month Year and Month Year under the supervision of Dr. Supervisor. My research was funded by this grant. I declare that no part of this thesis has been submitted in support of another degree, diploma or other qualification at the University of Blah or any other university. Except where otherwise stated, the work in this thesis is all mine."</em></p>

            <p>At this point in my thesis I also stated which of my chapters were based on already published papers. You can also make a statement about the copyright belonging to you, the author: <em>“No quotation from this thesis may be published without prior consent or acknowledgement of its author."</em></p>

            <p>The LaTeX template with then add your Contents and a List of Figures before jumping into the main thesis text. The List of Figures will be made from your figure captions. You can have both the main figure caption and a label that can go in your list of figures like this:</p>

            <p>\begin{figure}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{myfigure.pdf}
            \caption[This is the label that appears in the list of figures]{This is the text that will appear under the figure in the main text of your thesis.}
            \label{fig:myfigure}
            \end{figure}</p>

            <p>If you want references like in a MNRAS/ApJ/A&amp;A paper then you’ll also need to load the natbib package at the top of your thesis.tex file:</p>

            <p>\usepackage{natbib}</p>

            <p>If you want your references to be hyperlinks to your bibliography then also load the hyperref package and edit the following colours as you like:</p>

            <p>\usepackage{hyperref}</p>

            <p>\hypersetup{
                colorlinks,
                citecolor=black,
                filecolor=black,
                linkcolor=black,
                urlcolor=black
            }</p>

            <p>You’re probably also thinking that your thesis.tex file is going to get ridiculously long whilst you keep on churning out those words. Well don’t panic, there’s a better way. There’s a nifty little command \include which you can use to insert an entire .tex file into your thesis.tex file. For example, if you’re writing your introduction you might do that in a separate introduction.tex file and then in your thesis.tex file you can put the command:</p>

            <p>\include{introduction}</p>

            <p>Your introduction.tex file doesn’t need to have any of the messy package import commands that your thesis.tex file has at the top, you can just jump write in and start writing:</p>

            <p>\chapter{Introduction}
            The Universe is big and scary and this thesis is going to try and make it less so.</p>

            <p>And you can do this for all of your chapters. In theory it makes it easier to get down to writing. When you want to update your thesis.pdf file then you’d still compile your thesis.tex file no matter which chapter.tex file you’d been editing. I liked to keep my thesis folder organised so that each chapter was a separate folder with the chapter.tex file and all of the figures for that chapter. If you decide to do this too then when you include chapters in your main thesis file you’d need to put \include{name_of_folder/name_of_chapter_tex_file} like so:</p>

            <p>\include{introduction/introduction}</p>

            <p>Similarly when you’re inserting a figure:</p>

            <p>\begin{figure}
            \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{introduction/myintrofigure.pdf}
            \end{figure}</p>

            <p>You’re thesis folder then ends up looking a bit like this:</p>

            <a><img src="images/thesis_folder_example.png" alt="example thesis front page", width="100%"/></a>


            <p>References work the same way as in a paper or first &amp; second year reports. The easiest way to do this is have a references.bib file which contains all of the bibtex codes for the papers you cite. They’re really easy to obtain from ADS, each time you find a paper there’s always a button for getting the bibtex citation:</p>

            <a><img src="images/bibtex_example.png" alt="example thesis front page" width="100%"/></a>

            <p>Copy this bibtex code into your references.bib file and change the bib code to something more memorable. I usually go for author’s last name followed by the year, e.g. for the example above:</p>

            <p>@ARTICLE{smethurst2016,
               author = {{Smethurst}, R.~J. and {Lintott}, C.~J. and {Simmons}, B.~D. and
                {Schawinski}, K. and {Bamford}, S.~P. and {Cardamone}, C.~N. and
                {Kruk}, S.~J. and {Masters}, K.~L. and {Urry}, C.~M. and {Willett}, K.~W. and
                {Wong}, O.~I.},
                title = "{Galaxy Zoo: evidence for rapid, recent quenching within a population of AGN host galaxies}",
              journal = {\mnras},
            archivePrefix = "arXiv",
               eprint = {1609.00023},
             keywords = {galaxies: active, galaxies: evolution, galaxies: photometry, galaxies: Seyfert, galaxies: statistics},
                 year = 2016,
                month = dec,
               volume = 463,
                pages = {2986-2996},
                  doi = {10.1093/mnras/stw2204},
               adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.463.2986S},
              adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}
            }</p>

            <p>which I’d cite in my thesis as normal like this: \cite{smethurst2016}. To insert your list of references into your thesis you use the command:</p>

            <p>\bibliography{name_of_references_bib_file}</p>

            <p>If you want your references to appear the same as they do in your normal journal, then use your journal of choice’s .bst bibliography style file (e.g. for MNRAS this is mn2e.bst and is available <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/macros/latex2e/contrib/mnras/">here</a>) and include the command:</p>

            <p>\bibliographystyle{mn2e}
            \bibliography{name_of_references_bib_file}</p>


           <p>Ok, so now you’ve finished writing up your thesis (or maybe you’re just wishing you had) - what next? By the rules of the University, you have to submit 2 copies to exam schools for each of your examiners, one internal, one external, which your supervisor will sort out and speak with them about setting a date for your viva. These copies of your thesis have to be printed single sided and soft bound which means the pages are glued together and have a bit of thick paper at the back and a transparency at the front. Don’t worry you don’t have to do this - take it to the <a href="http://www.oxford-print-centre.co.uk/">Oxford Print Centre on Hollywell Street</a>, they know all about the University regulations and they’ll only charge you £6 per copy. They promise to bind your thesis in under an hour but I rang ahead and checked with them that was still the case on the day I was planning to bring mine in.</p>

            <p>Then you need to take your thesis to exam schools. The main entrance is on the High Street and the hand-in area is just on the left hand side. There’s guidelines for undergraduate submissions, which you should ignore, and focus on the postgraduate guidelines. You need to fill in a little form with your name and title and then put each of the copies of your thesis into it’s own envelope. You can get these envelopes from the nice guys in the Physics stores down on Level 3 (you know, the stationary wonderland);  they’ve been giving them out for years so know exactly what to give you. The nice person on the desk will then take your theses from you and promise to deliver them to your examiners. You’ll get an email confirming that you’ve handed in and when the thesis has been sent.</p>

            <p>After that, get down to the Lamb &amp; Flag for a well earned tipple.</p>

            <p>Remember, that all of this information is available on the <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/students/academic/exams/research?wssl=1">University of Oxford research examination website </a> and you should always check there for the official guidelines.</p>
